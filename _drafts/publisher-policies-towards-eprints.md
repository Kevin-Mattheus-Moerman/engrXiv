In the evolving landscape that is academic publishing, publishers have widely varying policies as it relates to archiving of preprints and postprints. However, finding these policies can be a difficult task. Fortunately there are resources available to make this task slightly easier. [Sherpa/RoMEO](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php) helps authors navigate each publisherâ€™s policies regarding preprints, postprints, copyright, and self-archiving. Summarized below are some comments on various engineering publisher's policies as they stand today. Note that these policies are changing all of the time so it is important to follow-up with your publisher of choice with each new paper.

## Institution of Engineering and Technology



## Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers



## American Society of Mechanical Engineers



## SAGE Publications




We hope that the engineering community will help us encourage the publishers who have strict policies against preprint and postprint archiving to reconsider their positions.
