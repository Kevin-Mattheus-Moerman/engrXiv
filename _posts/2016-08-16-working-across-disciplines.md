Are you a researcher who conducts multidisciplinary or interdisciplinary work? Then using a preprint server hosted on the [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io) is for you! In addition to great features such as the ability to upload multiple files and file types, OSF enables a preprint to be simultaneously posted to multiple archives. For now this includes [engrXiv](http://www.engrxiv.org) for engineering, [SocArXiv](http://www.socarxiv.org) for the social sciences, and [PsyArXiv](https://osf.io/view/psyarxiv/) for the psychological sciences.

Thus if you do work that is appropriate for both engrXiv and SocArXiv, for example, you can post it to both by simply adding both relevant tags to the preprint's page. The preprint will then be listed on both archives while pointing to the same page and will therefore be easily discoverable and accessible to members of both disciplines.
