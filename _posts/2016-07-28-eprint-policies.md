Potential submitters to engrXiv might be worried about whether submission of their manuscript will prevent them from later submitting to the journal of their choice. Fortunately, <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php" target="_blank">SHERPA/RoMERO</a> is here to help you navigate each publisher's policies regarding preprints, postprints, copyright, and self-archiving.

For preprints, SHERPA/RoMEO will help authors determine if the publisher allows authors to post a preprint and still be considered for publication.

For postprints, authors may determine if they are allowed to post a post-peerreviewed manuscript, either in final publisher's format or not.

As always, authors should refer to publisher policies posted on a journal's website and contact the editor if anything is unclear. Also, in some cases these policies are negotiable and it is the author's responsibility to know their rights and advocate on their own behalf.
