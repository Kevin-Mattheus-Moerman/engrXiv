New updates have been pushed to the engrXiv preprint page. For all preprints on the service, a new section appears showing recommended citation formatting for the preprint. Also, as seen on the [OSF Preprints roadmap document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SocElbBjc_Nhme4-SJv2_zytBd1ys8R5aZDb3POe94c/edit?usp=sharing), this citation section will later be updated to include the ability to copy/paste the citation in other formats such as Bibtex.
