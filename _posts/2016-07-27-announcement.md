We are happy to announce the newly created eprint server for engineering, engrXiv! Through a partnership with the Center for Open Science, we are building a free, open access, open source archive for engineering research and design. The initiative responds to growing recognition of the need for faster, open sharing of research and design on a truly open access platform for all engineering disciplines. Papers on engrXiv will be permanently available and free to the public.

The field of engineering is at a bifurcation when it comes publishing the methods, analyses, and results of research and design efforts. Engineers want to disseminate their results both for professional advancement and societal benefit, but many of the traditional publishing outlets can extend the time it takes for an engineering artifact to become public. engrXiv will enable engineers to rapidly disseminate their work to their colleagues and other stakeholders who will benefit from it. Free and open access to engineering knowledge has the power to enable father development within the field and the ability to build capacity for change within communities for which it would be the most beneficial.

Through the partnership with the Open Science Framework, papers on engrXiv will be permanently available and free to the public. This initiative lays the groundwork for a broader project that can provide access to data, code, and solid models along with papers, and provide public peer review of completed work. In short, the development and advancement of engrXiv will improve our ability to design and research, better connect us as engineers, and promote a greater sense of community around the dissemination of the ever-growing engineering body of knowledge.

The eprint server provides several important benefits to the engineering author:

Fast, free uploading of academic papers and open access for all readers
Free registration open to all, regardless of academic affiliation
Permanent identifiers that link to the latest version of a paper (authors can provide links to versions published elsewhere)
Full access and discoverability through Google Scholar and other research tools
The option to use any Creative Commons license
Comment and discussion on papers among registered users
Grouping of papers together for conferences or working groups
Analytics data on how often papers have been accessed
Easy sharing on social media sites – without requiring readers to register
“It is of paramount importance to the advancement of society that the knowledge and works contained within the field of engineering be openly accessible,” said engrXiv Director Devin Berg, an associate professor and engineer at the University of Wisconsin-Stout, which serves as the archive’s institutional home, “Regardless of an engineer's discipline, there are countless individuals and communities who could benefit from their work but lack academic or professional affiliation that would grant them access to the traditionally published scholarly output.”



Papers on engrXiv may be linked to the full suite of services available free through the Open Science Framework. OSF supports project management and collaboration, connects services across the research lifecycle, and archives data, materials, and other research objects for private use or public sharing.



engrXiv is directed by a steering committee, the members of which are listed on the About page.
