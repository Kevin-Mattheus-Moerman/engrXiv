For authors looking to submit their preprint to engrXiv, we now have a template available to help you with formatting! This template is not required for submission to engrXiv but for situations where you don't have any other formatting criteria, we think that this template provides a good place to start.

Some of the features of the template include:
* [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) researcher identifiers in the affiliation linked to your ORCID profile.
* Author-year style in text citations to aid readability.
* DOIs linked through [oaDOI](https://oadoi.org/) in the bibliography to help readers find an accessible version of your work.

You can make use of the template by [forking it on Github](https://github.com/OpenEngr/engrXiv-template) or through our partnership with Overleaf where it is available as an [Overleaf template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/engrxiv-template/ttrnvgdkgcgy).
