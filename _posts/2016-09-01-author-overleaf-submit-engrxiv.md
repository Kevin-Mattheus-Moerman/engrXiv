Thanks to a [new collaboration between the the Center for Open Science and Overleaf announced yesterday](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/356-overleaf-partners-with-the-center-for-open-science-on-a-new-osf-preprints-service), authors who draft their papers on Overleaf can now submit them directly to engrXiv from the Overleaf website. For those of you who are not familiar with Overleaf, it is a free service that lets you create, edit, and share your scientific ideas easily online using LaTeX right within your web browser. LaTeX takes care of the typesetting and formatting for you and Overleaf keeps you from having to install and configure LaTeX yourself.

Submitting couldn't be easier. Once you are finished authoring your paper on Overleaf, just click the "Journals & Services" tab at the top of the page, scroll down and select engrXiv.

On the next window click, "Submit Article to engrXiv" and you are all set.

We are really excited about this collaboration and how easy it makes it to get your article up on engrXiv as soon as it is ready.

Happy writing!
